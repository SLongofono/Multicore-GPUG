Basic Premise

We are reading in 3D image data (voxels) and outputting 2d images (pixels)

As such, we need to collapse one dimension.  In cartesian coordinates, we wish
to project Z onto the XY plane, Y onto the XZ plane, or X onto the YZ plane

There are many ways we can do this, but this specific project wants us to
create two separate projections for any given run: one which takes the sum of
values along the collapsed dimension, and one that takes the maximum of the
values along the collapsed dimension.

For example, say we have a 4x4x4 image, interpreted as x, y, and t.  We wish
to plot the maximum intensity at each pixel in the 2D image represented by
pairs (x,y).  So, for each pair (x,y), we iterate over all 4 values in the
third dimension t, and assign the maximum of all these values.  So given these
slices, each representing a different value of t:

t=0   t=1   t=2   t=3             composite projection
0000  0100  0210  0053   ----->   0253 
0000  0100  0210  0000   yields   0210 
0000  0100  0210  0800   ----->   0810 
0000  0100  0000  4001            4101
